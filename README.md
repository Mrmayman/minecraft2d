# minecraft2d
## About
A 2D Minecraft clone in C++ and SDL2, which also supports controllers!

## OS Support
**Windows** : Yes
**Linux** : Yes
**Everything else** : Use [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) and run the Windows version.

## Build
To build project:
- Run `./compile.sh` for Linux build.
- Run `./debuglinuxcompile.sh` for Linux build with debug symbols (for use with gdb for example)
- Run `./wincompile.sh` for Windows build.
You will find the linux compiled binary in `./bin/a.out` and the windows compiled binary in `./bin/game.exe`
The required dlls for windows version are bundled with the source code for easier setup.

Don't judge me for my terrible skills. I'm a beginner.
